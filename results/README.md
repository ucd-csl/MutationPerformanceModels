# Results

This folder contains the results from the experiments described in the paper. The results for each of the 5 benchmark models are available in files prefixed B1 to B5.

## change_by_metric_matrix.tsv
This file contains a double entry table (matrix) where columns correspond to a mutant and lines correspond to a performance metric. Each cell contains the minimum and maximum change in the metric by the mutant accross all workloads, in the for min ; max.

## raw.tsv
This file contains the raw results generated by the mutation tool and contains a line for each test/mutant/performance measure triple.
#### Schema: 
- test: the test that was run
- location: the node in the model that was mutated
- operator: the operator that was applied to generate the mutant
- alfa: the confidence interval set in JMT
- nodeType: whether the performance measure concerns a particular node (station) or the system (empty)
- precision: the precision with which the performance measure was collected
- station: the node for which the performance measure is collected (blank if system level measure, e.g. system response time)
- class: the class for which the performance measure is collected (blank if average measure, e.g. global response time)
- measureType: the performance measure collected
- orig_analyzedSamples: the number of samples analysed by JMT during the simulation of the original model
- orig_discardedSamples: the number of samples discarded by JMT during the simulation of the original model
- orig_lowerLimit: the lower limit of the performance measure during the simulation of the original model
- orig_maxSamples: the maximum number of samples JMT would collect before ending the simulation of the original model
- orig_meanValue: the mean value of the performance measure during the simulation of the original model
- orig_successful: whether the original model was simulated successfully with JMT
- orig_upperLimit: the upper limit of the performance measure during the simulation of the original model
- mut_analyzedSamples: the number of samples analysed by JMT during the simulation of the mutated model
- mut_discardedSamples: the number of samples discarded by JMT during the simulation of the mutated model
- mut_lowerLimit: the lower limit of the performance measure during the simulation of the mutated model
- mut_maxSamples: the maximum number of samples JMT would collect before ending the simulation of the mutated model
- mut_meanValue: the mean value of the performance measure during the simulation of the mutated model
- mut_successful: whether the mutated model was simulated successfully with JMT
- mut_upperLimit: the upper limit of the performance measure during the simulation of the mutated model
- timeoutMut: whether the simulation of the mutated model was stopped because it hit the timeout limit

## triggered_by_metric_matrix.tsv
This file contains a double entry table (matrix) where columns correspond to a mutant and lines correspond to a performance metric. Each cell indicates whether the mutant was triggered by any of the workloads for this metric.

## triggered_by_test_matrix.tsv
This file contains a double entry table (matrix) where columns correspond to a mutant and lines correspond to a workload. Each cell indicates whether the mutant was triggered by the workload for any of the performance metrics.
